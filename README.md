# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description

This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game for my Web Development class built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows two players to take turns marking `X` and `O` on a 3×3 grid. The game checks for a winner or a draw and displays an alert when the game ends.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay** (Player 1: `O`, Player 2: `X`).
- **Turn indicator** showing which player's turn it is.
- **Win detection** with predefined winning patterns.
- **Draw detection** if all cells are filled without a winner.
- **Custom alert box** to show the winner or a draw message.
- **Reset button** to restart the game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Provides the game structure.
- **CSS** – Styles the board and game elements.
- **JavaScript** – Handles the game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Player 1 (`O`) starts first, followed by Player 2 (`X`).
3. Click on an empty cell to place a mark.
4. The game announces a winner if a player gets three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
5. If all cells are filled and there's no winner, it's a **draw**.
6. Click **RESET** to start a new game.
